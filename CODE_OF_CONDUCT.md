# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our project follows the Contributor Covenant v2.0 to provide a welcoming
and harassment-free experience for everyone.

The short version:

- Be respectful and kind.
- Assume good faith when interacting with others.
- If someone is making a contribution, help them improve it rather than attacking.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the
maintainers by opening an issue or contacting the repository owner.
